		 * Exercise 1: Basic if statement
Write a Java program that takes an integer as input and prints "Even" if the number is even and "Odd" if it's odd.

Exercise 2: if-else statement
Write a program that takes two integers as input and prints the larger one.

Exercise 3: Nested if-else statement
Create a program that prompts the user for their age. If the age is less than 18, print "You are a minor." If it's between 18 and 65, print "You are an adult." Otherwise, print "You are a senior citizen."

Exercise 4: Multiple else if statements
Write a program that prompts the user for a numerical grade (0-100) and prints their corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).

Exercise 5: switch statement
Create a simple calculator program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) as input. Use a switch statement to perform the calculation and display the result.
